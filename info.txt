In order to have the graphviz visualization part working, you need to follow the instructions as described here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz
Compiling the dot code from python requires the dot executable to be on systems' path.

You can compile the dot code also from the cmd/console, for example as:
dot -Tpdf -o output.pdf top5000.gv

Several customisations will result in a more advanced visualization. Please see the graphviz documentation (file dot.1.pdf or online) for instructions. Here are some configurations I used:

	//layout=twopi
	//ranksep="10 20 15 10 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1"
	//nodesep=10
	//splines=ortho
	//root=0
	//overlap=false
